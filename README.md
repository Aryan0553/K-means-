## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify hidden patterns in data. 
It includes data preprocessing, elbow method analysis, 2D and 3D visualizations, and cluster assignment using Python.
---

## 🎯 Objective
To segment data points into optimal clusters by minimizing intra-cluster distance and improving pattern recognition.
---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
K-Means Clustering
Elbow Method for optimal K selection
Euclidean distance for centroid calculation
---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Plotly (3D Visualization)
---

## 📊 Key Features
Missing value handling
Scatter plot visualization
WCSS & Elbow curve analysis
Cluster labeling and color coding
Interactive 3D cluster visualization
---

## 📈 Results
The elbow method identified the optimal number of clusters, 
and K-Means successfully grouped data into meaningful segments with clear visual separation.
---

## 📁 Dataset
Synthetic and structured datasets with features such as CGPA and IQ were used for clustering analysis.
